# Understanding of Docker 

## What is Docker and Why Use It? 
Docker is an open-source project that allows engineers to build, test, and deploy software applications quickly using containers. It helps developers automate the deployment of applications and provides a consistent evironment to development and production enviroments so that software can run across multiple enviroments. When running docker, package collisions between multiple applications on the same computer can be avoided. Also protyping (or testing) new features is much easier. 

## Containers
Containers packages software into standard units with the libraries, system tools, and runtime it needs to run. A docker container image is lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything to run an application: the code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.
