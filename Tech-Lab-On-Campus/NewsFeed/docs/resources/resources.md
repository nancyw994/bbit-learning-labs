# Instructions for creating resource documents
In this directory, README documents should be created to introduce basic functionality of the technologies that will be used for this tech lab.

The technologies planned to be used are:  
* Python  
* JavaScript  
* React  
* Redis  
* Docker  

Follow example in https://bbgithub.dev.bloomberg.com/bbit/learning_labs/tree/main/Tech-Lab-On-Campus/Resources. Create a "basics" README for as many technologies as you can cover.
